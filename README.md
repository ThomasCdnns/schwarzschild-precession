# schwarzschild-precession
Simulate the trajectory of the star S2 in orbit around the black hole at the center of our galaxy and display in real time the value of the shift between the frequency of the received electromagnetic wave and the emitted wave (distinguishing between the Einstein effect, the Doppler effect of the first and second order).
